[![AbstruseCI](https://ci.bleenco.io/badge/2)](https://ci.bleenco.io/repo/2)

## Overview
Fully customisable cross-platform terminal that works and feels the same way everywhere: MacOS, Linux and Windows.

## Download
To download visit
[http://bterm.bleenco.io](http://bterm.bleenco.io) and hit the right button to get your favourite OS installer.

On the first run `~/.bterm2.json` (on Linux and MacOS) or `C:\Users\user\.bterm.json` (on Windows) configuration file is created. It contains the attributes in json format that define the layout of the terminal, i.e. changing the attribute `settings > fonts` will immediately update the type of fonts.

## Settings and customization

The default theme is a combination of black and white visuals.
Settings are stored in `.bterm2.json` configuration file where you can hack your terminals' visual settings.
